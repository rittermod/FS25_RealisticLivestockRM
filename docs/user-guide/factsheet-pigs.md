# Pigs Factsheet

Pigs are the most prolific breeders in Realistic Livestock RM, with litters of up to 16 piglets. They produce no special outputs (just manure), so their value comes entirely from selling offspring. The three breeds differ significantly in price — Berkshire commands a premium while Black Pied is the budget option.

## Breeds at a Glance

| Breed | Type | Target Weight (sow / boar) | Sell Value | Character |
|-------|------|---------------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Berkshire** | Premium | 140 / 180 kg | Highest | Most valuable per head |
| **Landrace** | Standard | 165 / 205 kg | Moderate | Balanced mid-range |
| **Black Pied** | Economy | 180 / 250 kg | Lowest | Cheapest, heaviest boars |

*Boars are heavier than sows and sell for more. Berkshire pigs eat the most but command the highest prices.*

## Sell Prices by Breed

Pig prices peak at 24 months and stay at that level for older animals (unlike cattle which decline).

### Typical Sell Prices ($)

| Breed | | Newborn | 6 mo | 24 mo (peak) |
|-------|---|---------|------|--------------|
| **Berkshire** | Sow | 45 | 450 | 1,600 |
| | Boar | 60 | 525 | 1,850 |
| **Landrace** | Sow | 40 | 400 | 1,400 |
| | Boar | 50 | 475 | 1,650 |
| **Black Pied** | Sow | 35 | 375 | 1,200 |
| | Boar | 45 | 450 | 1,500 |

*These are typical prices for an average, healthy animal. Actual prices vary widely — well-bred healthy animals sell for significantly more, while sick or poor-quality animals can sell for far less.*

### What Affects Sell Price

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Quality genetics | Better genetics → noticeably higher price |
| Weight | Well-fed animals near target weight are worth more |
| Health | Healthy animals sell for significantly more |
| Castrated | Small price bonus |
| Foot & Mouth | Substantially reduces price |

### Buy Prices

| Breed | Sow (newborn) | Sow (adult) | Boar (newborn) | Boar (adult) |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Berkshire** | 65 | 1,200 | 75 | 1,500 |
| **Landrace** | 55 | 1,100 | 65 | 1,400 |
| **Black Pied** | 45 | 1,000 | 55 | 1,200 |

## Food & Water by Breed

Genetics significantly affect how much each animal eats — some are naturally much more efficient than others. Lactating sows eat considerably more, and the Food Scale setting also adjusts consumption.

### Food Consumption Range (L/day)

| Breed | | Newborn | 24 mo (adult) |
|-------|---|---------|---------------|
| **Berkshire** | Sow | 5 – 30 | 30 – 210 |
| | Boar | 5 – 35 | 30 – 230 |
| **Landrace** | Sow | 4 – 25 | 25 – 175 |
| | Boar | 4 – 25 | 25 – 195 |
| **Black Pied** | Sow | 3 – 21 | 23 – 160 |
| | Boar | 4 – 25 | 24 – 170 |

*Berkshire pigs eat the most. Black Pied are the most efficient to feed. Ranges show the span from the most efficient to the hungriest animals. Most animals eat near the middle of these ranges.*

### Water Consumption (L/day, newborn → adult)

| Breed | Sow | Boar |
|-------|-----|------|
| **Berkshire** | 10 → 80 | 13 → 85 |
| **Landrace** | 8 → 75 | 8 → 80 |
| **Black Pied** | 6 → 68 | 8 → 72 |

*Lactating sows drink considerably more water than usual.*

## Weights by Breed

| Breed | | Birth | Target | Maximum |
|-------|---|-------|--------|---------|
| **Berkshire** | Sow | 1.6 kg | 140 kg | 1,050 kg |
| | Boar | 1.7 kg | 180 kg | 1,200 kg |
| **Landrace** | Sow | 1.4 kg | 165 kg | 1,050 kg |
| | Boar | 1.4 kg | 205 kg | 1,200 kg |
| **Black Pied** | Sow | 1.7 kg | 180 kg | 1,050 kg |
| | Boar | 1.8 kg | 250 kg | 1,200 kg |

*Black Pied boars have the highest target weight at 250 kg. Higher metabolism animals reach target weight faster but eat more. Castrated pigs gain weight faster than intact males.*

## Reproduction

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sow breeding age | 6+ months |
| Boar breeding age | 8+ months |
| Boar max breeding age | 48 months (4 years) |
| Sow fertility ends | 96 months (8 years) |
| Gestation | 4 months |
| Min health to breed | 75% |

> **Key insight:** Boars retire from breeding at just 4 years while sows can breed until 8 years. Plan your boar replacements early!

### Litter Sizes

Pig litters are the largest of any animal. Healthy sows at prime age almost always produce offspring:

| Sow Age | Chance of No Birth | Typical Litter | Large Litter |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 6–12 mo (young) | Low | 11–13 piglets | 14–16 possible |
| 13–36 mo (prime) | Very low | 11–13 piglets | 14–16 possible |
| 37–60 mo | Low–moderate | 11–13 piglets | 14–16 possible |
| 61–80 mo | Moderate | 11–13 piglets | Fewer |
| 81–96 mo (old) | High | Small litters | Rare |

*Most litters are 11–13 piglets. Very large litters of 14–16 are possible but less common. Low health significantly reduces litter sizes and increases the risk of the sow dying during birth.*

## Output

Pigs produce only manure and liquid manure — no milk, wool, or eggs. Their value is entirely in selling the animals.

| Breed | Manure (adult) | Liquid Manure (adult) |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Berkshire** | 50 / 55 | 91 / 95 |
| **Landrace** | 45 / 48 | 85 / 88 |
| **Black Pied** | 40 / 44 | 79 / 83 |

*Values shown as sow / boar.*

## Lifespan & Death

| Event | Age |
|-------|-----|
| Boar stops breeding | 48 months (4 years) |
| Sow stops breeding | 96 months (8 years) |
| Old age deaths begin | 180 months (15 years) |
| Maximum lifespan | ~240 months (20 years) |

*Death can be toggled off in settings. Accidents can happen at any age (affected by weather).*

## Diseases

| Disease | Spread | Fatal? | Treatment | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Foot & Mouth** | Moderately | Yes | Slow, moderate cost | Major price loss |
| **PED** | Moderately | Yes, devastating to newborns | Quick, affordable | Increased manure output |

> **PED warning:** Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea is extremely fatal in newborn piglets. In a large herd, a PED outbreak can wipe out an entire generation of offspring. Older pigs survive easily. See the [Disease Guide](guide-diseases.md).

## Tips

1. **Breeding is the business model.** With litters of 11–16 piglets every 4 months, a healthy sow can produce many piglets per year. Sell the excess for profit.

2. **Replace boars early.** Boars stop breeding at just 4 years — half the sow's fertile period. Buy young boars regularly or use artificial insemination.

3. **Berkshire for profit, Black Pied for volume.** Berkshire piglets sell for noticeably more but eat more. Black Pied are cheaper to maintain for large-scale operations.

4. **Watch for PED.** A single PED outbreak in a pen full of newborn piglets can kill most of them. Isolating young piglets or disabling diseases in settings can protect your investment.

5. **Pen capacity matters.** If a pen is full when piglets are born, the excess are automatically sold. Make sure you have room for those 11–16 piglet litters.
