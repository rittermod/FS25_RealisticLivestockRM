# FS25 Realistic Livestock - RitterMod version
This is a modified version of the [FS25 Realistic Livestock](https://github.com/Arrow-kb/FS25_RealisticLivestock) mod by [Arrow-kb](https://github.com/Arrow-kb) who has decided to stop all development of his mods.

The current goal of this version is to keep the core parts of the mod working for my use, and do the occasional fix or improvement that feel is needed. 

Feel free to use it as you see fit, but please understand that this mod is way less ambitious.
